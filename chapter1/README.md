# Chapter 1
This chapter doesn't have anything other than a basic hello world program. After explaining how to install rustup (and by extension Rust) with `$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh`, the documentation quickly moves on to explain `.rs` files and cargo (Rust's package manager & build system).

#### Key points:
- `.rs` - Rust file
- `rustc [file]` - Compile a file into an executable
- `cargo new [name]` - Create new cargo project
- `cargo build` - Builds a project
- `cargo run` - Builds *and* runs a project
