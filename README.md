# LearnRust

This project is a compilation of my working files for the [RustLang Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html) to learn Rust. Each chapter's project is its own folder with corresponding names. They are:

## [Chapter 1: Getting Started](https://github.com/Joshua-Burdick/LearnRust/tree/master/chapter1)
A short chapter detailing how to install Rust and get started running Rust programs.

## [Chapter 2: Guessing Game](https://github.com/Joshua-Burdick/LearnRust/tree/master/chapter2)
The program generates a secret number [1,100]. The user must guess the number.

## [Chapter 3: Common Concepts](https://github.com/Joshua-Burdick/LearnRust/tree/master/chapter3)
Variables, mutability, data types, functions, comments, control flow.
